# Codify

This project will hopefully be *the* todo app/project manager/resource aggregator for programmers (and other areas too!).

As I try to expand my skills, learn new technologies, and start projects, I find it extremely hard to organize what I'm doing. What's worse, the resources I put together for one project may be useful for another. But in 6 months when I start that project, they'll be lost. My goal to get this working is how I organize information on the app, and also how it's displayed.

The main view brings you to your current project. A **Project** has code (the name may change if I branch out to other genres). Code contains blocks. These blocks can contain actual code...formatted I hope, and resources. So for instance:

My Codify app will be the current project. It has a code section. This code is split up into many blocks. Blocks will probably be blockable (can break down into even smaller blocks of code). A sample block would be 'Rails project creation'. Super simple, but useful again and again. This block exists in the database, and can be used in other projects. The block has resources and code snippets that belong to it. These come along when a block is used elsewhere.

Eventually blocks should be shareable in a Codify community.

Blocks *do* have an ordering in Projects. I think a ranking might be useful here too. So if something is very project specific, it ranks 1. Rank 2 is semi specific, and Rank 3 applies to things like Rails project creation.

Clearly an important aspect of this is adding resources. This requires a browser add on. Fun!

That's the basic idea behind the app, and the main view. The other views are equally important, but this readme is getting long, and my project vision is getting blurry.
